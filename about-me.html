        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <p>uhh names: anchovii/anchoviii/anchov3i. its, uh, anchovy but 'ii' instead of 'y'.</p>
        <h2>other names</h2>
        <p>Necros: due to a combo of mojang services and The email just stopped existing. I was stuck with my brothers minecraft
             username. It used to make me cringe a little bit but I've been using it for actual years now, and when the minecraft
              migration finally forced me to get a new minecraft accout I kept the 'Necros' part.
        </p>
        <p><strong>[REAL NAME]</strong>: Self explanatory.</p>
        <p>Luce: So one of my characters in this minecraft server was named 'Luce Tawfin'. I put the first name in my 
            username buuuut I didn't participate in lore so then ppl just started assuming I was called 
            Luce, and so now I'm Luce.</p>

        <h1>Gender</h1>
        <p>My current gender journey has been to see how I feel when people say words to me. Much easier to go "yea I wanna be
             called This" when you're actually called it. Basically: don't be afraid of misgendering me! Any pronouns <em>means</em> any pronouns!
        </p>
        <p>
            Good: she/her, they/them, he/him, missus, mister
        </p>
        <p>
            Bad: nothing yet! uhh take this instead: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=geNMz0J9TEQ" target="_blank" class="squish"><img src="images/scout.gif" alt="the full meet the scout video in a gif"></a>
