                <h1>Active Interests</h1>
                <p>anything I'm actively keeping tabs on.</p>
                <h2><a href="https://bogleech.com/awfulhospital/intro">Awful Hospital</a></h2><p>cool webcomic</p>
                <h2><a href="https://corru.observer">corru.observer</a></h2><p>awesome web game. i opened it after having saved the link for like 2 week and then i played all of it from start to current content at that time (ep2). I don't even know why I found this game. I just randomly decided to open the stream suggestions channel in hollow_tones server once, found this and then never opened that channel again.</p>
                
                <h2><a href="#">Disco Elysium</a></h2><p>point and click adventure game where you play as. Him. whats the state on the devthing anyways I'm not sure. in any case go look into the deal with ZAUM studio and the people who made disco elysium so you can figure out if you want to [OBTAIN IT. LEGALLY. SMILING.] or give ZAUM your money</p>
                <h2><a href="https://mangadex.org/title/d90ea6cb-7bc3-4d80-8af0-28557e6c4e17/dungeon-meshi?tab=art">Dungeon Meshi</a></h2><p>really good manga. and anime now too! Read it read it nowww its like if someone looked at fantasy and was like "what if I made an awesome thing of this". what i just typed was absolute nothing- point is its good</p>
                <h2><a href="https://www.fallenlondon.com">Fallen London</a></h2><p>fuuuuck i open fallen london im like "yeah ok whatever" and im just realizing im hooked onto this game several weekly rewards later. uh, it has an energy system and stuff locked behind a paywall. some of the paid stuff is Neat Sidecontent (presumable IDK havent bought it) and then you also
                    have the generic pay-for-more-actions stuff. Don't buy actions. if you can get through the initial grind, you'll be met with more grind AND neat writing. yeah dont play this game if you hate grind. do play this game if you want to read cool words. or if you like making your character stare at bones all day every day to get enough money to afford their horrible, horrible laudanum addiction.
                    <br> i opened up ff14 again after some months and im realizing. if you loooveee pressing buttons in a specific order and optimizing the pressing of buttons to get funny items fallen london is also for you. crafting 500 copper bars gives me no real ingame benefit but i love pushing those buttons- oh this is the Fallen London section, copper? I mean Bessemer Steel Ingots. fallen london, again, at least is like a book you can only read a page of every day and not just push button get rocks.
                </p>
                <h2>Fanfiction, Various</h2><p>really anything that manages to get me to search up the media it's for just so I can get a mental image of what the setting and characters look like.
                    <br>...I like reading fanfiction about series I know nothing about.
                </p>
                <p>
                    okayy notable ones... 
                    <br>spoilers for ULTRAKILL, Murder Drones. <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/47687632">'ultramurderkill'</a> is Fantastic but also hasn't updated in months. murder robot wakes up in a distinctively not-murdery body. love the characterization in here.
                    <br>spoilers for... Star Wars, uh, anything involving Anakin and Din. <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/38850561">'Way of Conquest'</a> is really fun. It doesn't have an end, despite the chapter count. an armoured father gets time-travelled (though he thinks he just got teleported) directly above a non-armoured supreme chancellor. processes occur.
                    <br>spoilers for, uh, any part of star wars involving Anakin and Leia. <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/31764097">'Duty Bound'</a> sends a character back in time but they're Hashtag Silly (they have not told anyone they're from the past. not as a rules thing they just have a Plan)
                    <br>spoilers for Lisa the Pointless and Deltarune (Ch. 1). <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/33958690">'Underside of Home'</a> has two old men meet a young(?) prince(?) while being pursued.
                    <br>MAJOR spoilers for Hollow Knight, and also Rain World is there too. <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/45731938">A Doleful Creature No More</a> is a comic where a slugcat meets god.
                    <br>Literally the entirety of Slay the Princess rewritten, and also major spoilers for Disco Elysium. <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works/51760693">THE FURY OF A SHATTERED MIRROR</a> puts a guy whos broken into multiple pieces in the place of where a creature whos broken into multiple pieces would normally go. 
                </p>
                <h2>Lisa the Painful and related</h2>
                <p>what if an old guy was so so sad</p>
                <p>there are so many fangames. i like a few of them</p>
                <h3><a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/LISA-The-Timeless/629435">Lisa the Timeless</a></h3><p>Good RPGMaker game. I don't know why I like it so much. Similar to other games in that you play an old dude with back problems.</p>
                <h3><a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/lisa-the-unbreakable/440612">Lisa the Unbreakable</a></h3><p>Good RPGMaker game.</p>
                <h2><a href="https://prismlauncher.org/">Modded Minecraft</a></h2><p>big fan of thaumcraft 4, roots 3, and farmers delight. love betweenlands love hexcasting god that mod made my head hurt but then I like watched a tutorial and now I know how to read the guidebook. chromaticraft good too.
                    <br> Also play <strong><a href="https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/blightfall.592618/mods">Blightfall</a></strong> its an incredibly made thaumcraft 4 pack.
                </p>
                <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/">Outer Wilds</a></h2><p>Have you played Outer Wilds? Do you play Outer Wilds? Will you play Outer Wilds? When will you play Outer Wilds? as someone who played through the entire thing on a laptop at a constant below-15 fps having to adjust for the delay in me moving my mouse, it's one of the best games I've ever played. Go into it without spoilers (or at least with a co-pilot who won't be like "lol whats [CLUE TO SPOILER] aha wonder what that could be").</p>
                <h2><a href="https://www.prequeladventure.com/2022/08/katia-embrace-elitism/#disqus_thread">Prequel Adventure</a></h2><p>(2023/Oct/2) one day the short man will update the comic</p>
                <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/294100/RimWorld/">Rimworld</a></h2><p>One of those games where the mods are quality enough that you're missing out without them. But, still playable on its own! This game is addictive. I love it. You don't have to commit war crimes on purpose in this game. (...putting raiders in blood chambers to produce blood for my vampires isn't war crimes...) I'm still on my first colony as of typing this. They keep slapping the shit out of eachother. Most of my blood use is making my vampires use their blood magic to heal eachother when they decide to just fight eachother. Game good.</p>
                <h2>Roblox, Specific</h2><p>roadblocks. it's mostly money-hungry microtransaction filled SLOP!! but there is still some actual games hidden within.
                    <br><a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/164051105/Super-Bomb-Survival">Super Bomb Survival</a>. Gameplay consists of #surviving as the world crumbles around you... either that or slapping people into lava and throwing spikes onto others.
                    <br><a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/6516141723/DOORS">DOORS</a>. Horror game. If the specimens in Spookys Jumpscare Mansion are like a tightrope you have to cross quickly, the entities in DOORS are like axes being thrown at you. What I just typed was nothing. Part of the game is learning how to Not Die, so go into it blind.
                    <br><a href="https://www.roblox.com/games/4714308751/Defend-The-Train-BETA">Defend the Train</a>. Defend the Train.
                </p>
                <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1262350/SIGNALIS/">Signalis</a></h2><p>me opening the game knowing absolutely nothing aside from seeing ppl on tumblr talking about the lesbian robot game. going from Wheres the lesbian to Oh theres the lesbian to Oh my god its been lesbian since the start</p>
                <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjovnvbcoKM&list=PLBRWWri3FMZ266GNQWhS0Fz9kLzE56VnU">Sunforged</a></h2><p>dnd show. is good</p>
                <h2><a href="https://angusnicneven.com/Terminal_230">Terminal 230</a></h2><p><strong>Extreme epilepsy warning for this whole site. Some of these pages want to rip your eyes out of your sockets with how much they flicker colours.</strong> really cool site. the quality of the boxes <a href="map.html" style="color:black;text-decoration:none;" title="hehehe">are</a> impeccable. the every other part of the site is neat too, I guess.</p>
                <h2><a href="#">Thaumcraft</a></h2><p>Thaumcraft. Thaumcraft seven. Look at me.</p><p>Thaumcraft 7 is a mod being made by the CoFH team as an official continuation of Azanors thaumcraft 1-6.</p>
                <p>There are several sneak peeks and videos, with screenshots being posted every few weeks in the CoFH discord. Wands. Thaumonomicon. New research system.</p><p>If you don't read the pins, every user is contractually obligated to raise their eyebrow at you and shake their heads disapprovingly.</p>
                <h2>Twitch (various)</h2><p>im not. making a category for each streamer i watch. anyways. <a href="https://tomatotruth.com/" alt="the dark truth behind twitch streamer Tomato Gaming">tomato</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/socksbx">socksbx</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/hollow_tones">hollow_tones</a>. go watch them.</p>
                <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229490/ULTRAKILL/">Ultrakill</a></h2><p>really good game. doing a fist only run has rendered me unable to use weapons. if someone tells you that you need to learn how to "triple gunkboost" or that you're playing like this one person they don't like, you don't have to listen to them.</p>
                <h2><a href="https://www.worldofio.info/">World of IO</a></h2><p>dnd show series thing. go watch goblins of io. or like, any of the several other things they have.</p>

                <h2><a href="adarkroom.doublespeakgames.com/">adarkroom</a></h2><p>pretty neat browser game.</p>
                <h2><a href="https://www.bscotch.net/">Butterscotch Shenanigans</a></h2><p>Games are good, both mobile and not. Waiting for crashlands 2.</p>
                <h2><a href="https://candybox2.github.io/">Candy Box 2</a></h2><p>hell fucking yes candy box 2 candy box 2 yes. YES. Play this game. Specifically wait to get like what was it 30 candies and then click the more features button. This game was corru observer before corru observer to me. Play corru observer. Play candy box 2. Play a dark room. Where am I</p>
                <h2><a href="https://www.deeprockgalactic.com/">Deep Rock Galactic</a></h2><p>gunkblaster main. that is not what the weapon is called but its a corrosive gunkblaster. Play it. Scared of multiplayer? The game gives you a drone (BOSCO) when playing solo specifically to let people play solo without losing out on revives and an ally.</p>

                <h2>Final Fantasy 14</h2><p>got to level 60 fishing on a character, decided my name sucks (I didn't know the cat ppl had naming conventions D:), and now I'm on a new character (now completely ignoring conventions instead of accidentally going against them). not that active but I do want to get around to (re)playing it more.
                    If you ever get someone to play ff14? Just a heads up. Don't poke at every bad thing in ARR? This behaviour is why I stopped playing on my first account. It felt like I being told I wasn't supposed to enjoy anything about the game I was playing until 'the good part'. <sub>reminds me of 'skip to act 5'...</sub>

                <h2><a href="https://findeverything.miraheze.org/wiki/Find_Everything">Find Everything</a></h2><p>one of those roblox games that is an actual game and not. Eat Sludge Simulator (17+)</p>

                <h2>Starbound (<strong>HEAVILY</strong> modded)</h2><p>I don't know why I keep coming back to it. It's my most played steam game, somehow.</p>
                <h2>Cookie Run: Ovenbreak</h2><p>they used to do events where you played a bit and then got a maxed-out good character. thats why I had a maxed-out lemon cookie, dj cookie, and whipped cream cookie. they literally annihilated skater cookie off of the face of the earth for no reason. oh yeah and all the microtransactions sucked too. you know what this game has done for me though? Its given me a reason to never play a gacha again (like i got poked to play genshin one time and. the rates man... what was it like 0.5% chance to pull like a 5 star)</p>
                <h2><a href="https://bambosh.dev/unofficial-homestuck-collection/" target="_blank">Homestuck</a></h2><p>my first experiences with homestuck were youtube videos. like the salt and pepper diner one. I don't think I even knew it was a webcomic I could read for a hot minute. regardless if you ever want to read homestuck, USE THE UNOFFICIAL COLLECTION! It, uh, actually functions (thanks bambosh(no thanks Viz Media)). Anyways homestuck is a webcomic that has really high highs and really, awfully low lows. Its fine.</p>
