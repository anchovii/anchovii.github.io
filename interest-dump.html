        <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/">Outer Wilds</a></h2><p>Have you played Outer Wilds? Do you play Outer Wilds? Will you play Outer Wilds? When will you play Outer Wilds? as someone who played through the entire thing having to adjust for the delay in looking around bc I was playing on a laptop, it's one of the best games I've ever played. Go into it without spoilers (or at least with a co-pilot who won't be like "lol whats [CLUE TO SPOILER] aha wonder what that could be").</p>
