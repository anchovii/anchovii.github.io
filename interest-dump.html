                <h1>Active Interests</h1>
                <p>anything I'm actively keeping tabs on.</p>
                <h2><a href="https://bogleech.com/awfulhospital/intro">Awful Hospital</a></h2><p>cool webcomic</p>
                <h2><a href="https://corru.observer">corru.observer</a></h2><p>awesome web game. i opened it after having saved the link for like 2 week and then i played all of it from start to current content at that time (ep2). I don't even know why I found this game. I just randomly decided to open the stream suggestions channel in hollow_tones server once, found this and then never opened that channel again.</p>
                <h2><a href="#">Deep Rock Galactic</a></h2><p>a</p>
                <h2><a href="https://mangadex.org/title/d90ea6cb-7bc3-4d80-8af0-28557e6c4e17/dungeon-meshi?tab=art">Dungeon Meshi</a></h2><p>really good manga. and anime now too! Read it read it nowww its like if someone looked at fantasy and was like "what if I made an awesome thing of this". what i just typed was absolute nothing- point is its good</p>
                <h2><a href="https://www.fallenlondon.com">Fallen London</a></h2><p>fuuuuck i open fallen london im like "yeah ok whatever" and im just realizing im hooked onto this game several weekly rewards later. uh, it has an energy system and stuff locked behind a paywall. some of the paid stuff is Neat Sidecontent (presumable IDK havent bought it) and then you also
                    have the generic pay-for-more-actions stuff. Don't buy actions. if you can get through the initial grind, you'll be met with more grind AND neat writing. yeah dont play this game if you hate grind. do play this game if you want to read cool words. or if you like making your character stare at bones all day every day to get enough money to afford their horrible, horrible laudanum addiction.
                </p>
                <h2>Lisa the Painful and related</h2>
                <p>what if an old guy was so so sad</p>
                <p>there are so many fangames. i like some of them</p>
                <h3><a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/LISA-The-Timeless/629435">Lisa the Timeless</a></h3><p>Good RPGMaker game. I don't know why I like it so much. Similar to other games in that you play an old dude with back problems.</p>
                <h3><a href="https://gamejolt.com/games/lisa-the-unbreakable/440612">Lisa the Unbreakable</a></h3><p>Good RPGMaker game.</p>
                <h2><a href="https://prismlauncher.org/">Modded Minecraft</a></h2><p>big fan of thaumcraft 4, roots 3, and farmers delight. love betweenlands love hexcasting god that mod made my head hurt but then I like watched a tutorial and now I know how to read the guidebook. chromaticraft good too.
                    <br> Also play <strong><a href="https://www.technicpack.net/modpack/blightfall.592618/mods">Blightfall</a></strong> its an incredibly made thaumcraft 4 pack.

                <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/753640/Outer_Wilds/">Outer Wilds</a></h2><p>Have you played Outer Wilds? Do you play Outer Wilds? Will you play Outer Wilds? When will you play Outer Wilds? as someone who played through the entire thing on a laptop at a constant below-15 fps having to adjust for the delay in me moving my mouse, it's one of the best games I've ever played. Go into it without spoilers (or at least with a co-pilot who won't be like "lol whats [CLUE TO SPOILER] aha wonder what that could be").</p>
                <h2><a href="https://www.prequeladventure.com/2022/08/katia-embrace-elitism/#disqus_thread">Prequel Adventure</a></h2><p>(2023/Oct/2) one day the short man will update the comic</p>
                <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1262350/SIGNALIS/">Signalis</a></h2><p>me opening the game knowing absolutely nothing aside from seeing ppl on tumblr talking about the lesbian robot game. going from Wheres the lesbian to Oh theres the lesbian to Oh my god its been lesbian since the start</p>
                <h2><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjovnvbcoKM&list=PLBRWWri3FMZ266GNQWhS0Fz9kLzE56VnU">Sunforged</a></h2><p>dnd show. is good</p>
                <h2><a href="https://angusnicneven.com/Terminal_230">Terminal 230</a></h2><p><strong>Extreme epilepsy warning for this whole site. Some of these pages want to rip your eyes out of your sockets with how much they flicker colours.</strong> really cool site. the quality of the boxes <a href="map.html" style="color:black;text-decoration:none;" title="hehehe">are</a> impeccable. the every other part of the site is neat too, I guess.</p>
                <h2>Twitch (various)</h2><p>im not. making a category for each streamer i watch. anyways. tomato and socksbx and hollow_tones. go watch them.</p>
                <h2><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1229490/ULTRAKILL/">Ultrakill</a></h2><p>really good game. doing a fist only run has rendered me unable to use weapons. if someone tells you that you need to learn how to "triple gunkboost" or that you're playing like this one person they don't like, you don't have to listen to them.</p>
                <h2><a href="https://www.worldofio.info/">World of IO</a></h2><p>dnd show series thing. go watch goblins of io.</p>

                <h2>Final Fantasy 14</h2><p>got to level 60 fishing on a character, decided my name sucks (I didn't know the cat ppl had naming conventions D:), and now I'm on a new character (now completely ignoring conventions instead of accidentally going against them). not that active but I do want to get around to (re)playing it more.
                    If you ever get someone to play ff14? Just a heads up. Don't poke at every bad thing in ARR? This behaviour is why I stopped playing on my first account. It felt like I wasn't supposed to enjoy anything about the game I was playing until 'the good part'. <sub>reminds me of 'skip to act 5'...</sub>

                <h2>Starbound (<strong>HEAVILY</strong> modded)</h2><p>I don't know why I keep coming back to it. It's my most played steam game, somehow.</p>
                <h2>Cookie Run: Ovenbreak</h2><p>they used to do events where you played a bit and then got a maxed-out good character. thats why I had a maxed-out lemon cookie, dj cookie, and whipped cream cookie. they literally annihilated skater cookie off of the face of the earth for no reason. oh yeah and all the microtransactions sucked too. you know what this game has done for me though? Its given me a reason to never play a gacha again (like i got poked to play genshin one time and. the rates man... what was it like 0.5% chance to pull like a 5 star)</p>
