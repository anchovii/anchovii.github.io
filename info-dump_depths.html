            <p>Mechanical humanoids capable of a great many things, depending on what body parts they're wearing.
            Mechae are most commonly seen near the towns and outposts they carve out for themselves, though it isn't uncommon to see one out in the wilderness or within other civilizations.
        
            </p>
            <div id="mechaeLight" class="hide">
                <p>Home-bound workers have easy access to charge stations, while those needing to do extended remote work must
                    install portable generators inside themselves, either powered by concentrated <strong>Juice</strong> or more mundane fuels.
                    <br>While certain parts can be common between mechae, it's rare to see one mechae who looks identical to another.</p>
                    <p>Mechae are formed when the proper components are within a <strong>Juice</strong>-saturated environment, such as within a scrapyard, spontaneously forming a conscious core.
                        Most quickly die when the surrounding soul energy flows elsewhere, but rarely,
                        one of these cores will be formed pre-attached to functional limbs, allowing it to cobble together a body capable of functioning without being immersed in a <strong>Juice</strong>-rich environment.
                        <br>Most mechae, however, are created when a full body with the parts needed to form a core are placed in the appropriate environment, waking up with everything they need to
                        function normally. This is usually done by other people who are in need of more bodies, and can't be bothered with finding someone to hire.
                    </p>
                    <p>Most people avoid keeping spare parts near eachother for extended periods of time, as it is not impossible to come back home to a
                        newly born mechae trying to break out of your house.
                    </p>
                    <p>Due to cores being formed from soul, each one comes with its own blend of mannerisms, affected by the experiences of whoever was within the <strong>Juice</strong> that awakened them.</p>

            <p>A group of bugs who've introduced a funny fungus into themselves. They're not dead- some people claim they're more alive than anyone else-
                but their jerky movement and the occasional rotting bodypart gives those unused to them some pause.
                <br>They're generally friendly to strangers, though the reputations of outsiders spread quickly between their colonies.
                <p>Cordysects aren't too durable, but are capable of quickly recovering from injuries that would be fatal without their fungal attributes.
                    Injuries still wear down on them over time, and routine mendings will eventually lead them to become more fungus than bug.
                    Overgrown cordysects aren't terribly mobile, but are more adept at managing fungal connections.

            <p>Common activities include immediately attacking anything that might be hostile to her, relishing in the consequences of her actions, and running from the consequences of her actions.
                Generally a menace, but appreciated in cordysectic colonies for the large corpses she drags in. She can siphon the volatile fuel from her internal reserves to make their IEDs.

            <p>A little droplet a long way from home. Followed Ieda after being found slinking around a remote juice refinement facility. It doesn't know much about things like "pronouns" or "dangerous machinery", so she just follows whatever Ieda does.
                Capable of growing extra 'limbs' for use in grappling or grabbing things, though she needs to cool down after any particularly demanding stunts. The caustic acid they produce is used by Ieda for her IEDs.

            <p>Research AI intent on discovering a new way to create sapient intelligence without the use of Juice, volatile and random as it is.
                Lack of resources has created a need to gather more resources, leading to... conflict with other
                mechae and insectoids. Eddi has pivoted more towards 'self-defense', repurposing failed attempts into constructs that aid in recycling foes into resources for
                further manufacturing
            </p>
            <p>Eddi would take a look at the military landmine-exploding spider robot and go "It should have a thinking sentient mind capable of pain I think. This would
                improve its capabilities, maybe. In my opinion."

            <p>Sapient virus given an opportunity to replicate itself across thousands of bodies. They don't really care what Eddi tells it to do, they just like being able to see through thousands of eyes.
            Due to effectively being the same person, host-robots are more predictable than Eddi's other experiments. This makes them decent for resource-harvesting and security, though easy to trick.
