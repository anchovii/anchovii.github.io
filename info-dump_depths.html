        <div class="biobar"><img src="images/sluggy.png"><li>Mechae</li></div>
        <p>Mechanical humanoids capable of a great many things, depending on what body parts they're wearing when you ask them to do something.
        Mechae are most commonly seen near the cities and outposts they build for themselves, though it isn't uncommon to see one out in the wilderness or within other civilizations.

            <p>Home-bound workers have easy access to charge stations, while those needing to do extended remote work must
                install portable generators inside themselves, either powered by concentrated <strong>juice</strong> or organic matter.
                <br>Bodies are mostly modular, with some cobbling together their own specialized body parts</p>

        <p>This is what you get if you give a so so scared prey animal a big metal arm to punch things with.</p>
        <div id="sc4vLight" style="display:none;">
            <p>They hate it here. Only alive because they accidentally flipped out of a minecart and got knocked out in the middle of nowhere before his co-workers started vanishing.
                Still alive because one of their hobbies was preparing for horrific apocalypse scenarios. They were expecting like, maybe a biblical amount of locusts or a reactor meltdown though.
                </p>
            <p>Wears a big cloak and sticks with cycloptic heads due to their durability.</p>
            <p>Quite adept at swapping out their own parts due to their previous job requiring them to survey varying perilous environments.
                <br>They should be allowed to make and weld a jaw to their head to bite people with. Teeth locally sourced from local wildlife, of course.

        <p>Silly little critter, if by silly and little you mean kinda pissy and somewhat lanky.
        Follows SC-4V because they seem really intent on being really really loud and drawing attention from the local wildlife, 
        providing Zvezter an opportunity to see how their pickaxe works on something other than rocks.

        <div class="biobar"><img src="images/icons/iedaSmall.png"><li>Ieda</li> <li>She/Them</li> <li>Droid</li> <li>Enthusiastic Executioner</li></div>
        <p>The third most excited for the complete downfall of her town. Common activities include being a menace to anything that could be defined as hostile to her, relishing in the consequences of her actions, and running from the consequences of her actions.
            Has no qualms with rending her previous co-workers down to scrap. She can siphon the volatile fuel from her internal reserves to make their IEDs.

        <p>A little droplet a long way from home. Followed Ieda after being found slinking around a remote juice refinement facility. It doesn't know much about things like "pronouns" or "dangerous machinery", so she just follows whatever Ieda does.
            Capable of growing extra 'limbs' for use in puncturing, grappling or grabbing things, though she needs to cool down after any particularly demanding stunts. The caustic acid they produce is used by Ieda for her IEDs.

        <p>A completely normal city ran by a really really good overseer that only wants the best for their
            employees. Any robots that never leave do so because they love it so much here.
            Please send more inspectors.

        <p><s>Benevolent overseer of DON</s> Site manager that aims to improve facility productivity by... 'recycling' everyone and replacing them with
            this weird guy --- found hiding in a recycle bin.

        <p>Sapient virus given an opportunity to replace the minds of robots. They don't really care what --- tells it to do, it just likes being able to see through thousands of eyes. 
            An infected robot usually isn't that smart (they mostly just do one thing over and over),
            unless they're built to be able to think for whatever purpose.
