        <p>a second surface beneath the first. host to bots and bugs alike. the fog above is dense enough
            to form crystals and coagulated pools of Juice, but not enough to be perilous to life.

        <p>Mechanical humanoids capable of a great many things, depending on what body parts they're wearing when you ask them to do something.
        Mechae are most commonly seen near the cities and outposts they build for themselves, though it isn't uncommon to see one out in the wilderness or within other civilizations.

            <p>Home-bound workers have easy access to charge stations, while those needing to do extended remote work must
                install portable generators inside themselves, either powered by concentrated <strong>juice</strong> or organic matter.
                <br>Bodies are mostly modular, with some cobbling together their own specialized body parts</p>

        <div id="sc4vLight" style="display:none;">
            <p>They hate it here. Only alive because they accidentally flipped out of a minecart and got knocked out in the middle of nowhere just before all of his co-workers were... converted.
                Still alive because one of their hobbies was preparing for horrific apocalypse scenarios. They were expecting like, maybe an unending swarm of insects or a reactor meltdown though.
                </p>
            <p>Wears a big cloak and sticks with cycloptic heads due to their durability.</p>

        <p>The third most excited for the complete downfall of her town. Common activities include: hanging out with Avo, being a menace to anything that could be defined as hostile to her.
            Has no qualms with ripping her previous co-workers to bits. She can siphon the volatile fuel from her internal reserves to make their IEDs.

        <p>A little droplet a long way from home. Followed Ieda after being found slinking around a remote juice refinement facility. It doesn't know much about things like "pronouns" or "dangerous machinery", so she just follows whatever Ieda does.
            Capable of growing extra 'limbs' for use in puncturing, grappling or grabbing things, though she needs to cool down after any particularly demanding stunts. The caustic acid they produce is used by Ieda for her IEDs.

        <p>A completely normal city ran by a completely normal overseer that only wants the best for their
            employees. Any inspectors that come here from other cities never come back because they love it so much here.
            Please stop sending inspectors. Please stop sending inspectors. Please stop sending inspectors. Thank you.
            Wait actually please send more inspectors.
            But stop giving them weapons. Thank you.  We offer 168 hour work weeks to maximize your work hours. That's more money for us, but also more
             money for you.

        <p><s>Benevolent overseer of DON</s> Site manager that aimed to improved facility productivity by
            removing all employee autonomy via. overwriting their brains. May have a bit of a god complex,
            but thats just baseless rumours. Probably.

        <p>Sentient virus given an opportunity to infest the back-up network used in the event of a destroyed body. An infected robot usually isn't that smart (they don't need to be to do the same exact thing over and over and over),
            unless special attention is devoted to them specifically. They like being able to see thousands of times over all at the same time.
