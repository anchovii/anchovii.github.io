        <img src="images/sluggy.png">
        <p>Predominantly found near their floor-to-ceiling spires, though you may spot them travelling via. vehicle.
            Powered off of electricity. Home-bound workers have easy access to charge stations, while those needing to do extended remote work must
            install portable generators inside themselves, usually powered by <strong>juice</strong>.
            <br>Bodies are mostly modular, though not many people do enough tasks that warrant swapping out limbs for each job.

        <img src="images/sluggy.png">
        <p>They hate it here. Only alive because they accidentally flipped out of a minecart and got knocked out in the middle of nowhere just before all of his co-workers were... converted.

        <h2>Ieda : She/Her, Droid, Thriving</h2>
        <img src="images/sluggy.png">
        <p>The third most excited for the complete downfall of her town. Common activities include: hanging out with Avo, being a menace to anything that could be defined as hostile to her.
            Has no qualms with ripping her previous co-workers to bits.
        </p>
        <h2>Avo : It/She, Blood Fiend</h2>
        <img src="images/sluggy.png">
        <p>A little droplet a long way from home. Followed Ieda after being found slinking around a remote juice refinement facility. It doesn't know much about things like "pronouns" or "dangerous machinery", so she just follows whatever Ieda does.
            Capable of growing extra 'limbs' for use in puncturing, grappling or grabbing things, though she needs to cool down after any particularly demanding stunts.

        <h1>DON'T COME HERE THERE IS NOTHING GOING ON THANK YOU <sub>previously: the citadel</sub></h1>
        <p>A completely normal city ran by a completely normal overseer that only wants the best for their
            employees. Any inspectors that come here from other cities never come back because they love it so much here.
            Please stop sending inspectors. Please stop sending inspectors. Please stop sending inspectors. Thank you.
            Wait actually we changed our minds. Please send more inspectors.
            But stop giving them weapons. Thank you.  We offer 168 hour work weeks to maximize your earnings.
            We need workers.

        <p><s>Benevolent manager of DON</s> Site manager that aimed to improved facility productivity by
            removing all employee autonomy via. overwriting their brains. May have a bit of a god complex,
            but thats just baseless rumours. Probably.

        <img src="images/sluggy.png">
        <p>Sentient virus given an opportunity to infest the back-up network used in the event of a destroyed body. An infected robot usually isn't that smart (they don't need to be to do the same exact thing over and over and over),
            unless special attention is devoted to them specifically.
