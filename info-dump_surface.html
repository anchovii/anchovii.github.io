        <p>the fog roaming the surface has rendered most areas uninhabitable.
            regardless of you being organic or mechanical, that wont stop the crystals from growing into your joints and clogging your guts.
        unless you're in an area that has less fog density, or maybe if you use a big bubble and roll around everywhere like in monkey ball.</p>

        <p>i format this better later. Yay</p>
        <p>
            uhh basically soul + coagulant in the air. areas shift from being soul-saturated to not. saturated areas have crystals form on surfaces, with crystals being prioritized over bare surfaces. this is why the surface sucks for anything that moves.
            crystals slowly sublimate back into fog. viscous soul, or Juice, forms within large enough crystals, which evaporates rapidly if left alone.
        </p>
        <p>the cavern ceiling of the depths prevents the fog from seeping through and killing everything below, though enough soul flows through to still be able to form roaming patches of saturated area.</p>
        <p>many depth dwellers use Juice for various things. Juice refinement produces a powerful fuel source as well as Slop™️ that allows for production and maintaining of AI. 
            wandering mechae scavenge raw Juice to fuel themselves.

        <div class="biobar"><img src="images/sluggy.png"><li>Spirits</li></div>
        <p>one of the few creatures that can survive their body being crystallized by the fog, on account of not having a body.
            their spirit is bound to a physical object. if this is destroyed, they will begin to lose body cohesion and sanity over time, before dissipating into fog.
