        <p>adarkroom. pretty neat browser game.</p>
        <p>Awful Hospital. really good webcomic about a mom trying to save her son. also there is a dog.</p>
        <p>Candy Box 2. really really really good browser game. idk why I like it so much.</p>
        <p>corru.observer. really cool browser-based game. similar to hypnospace? play it. or do what I did, and save the link, put off clicking the link for 2 weeks, then click the link and instantly get hooked.</p>
        <p>Deltarune.</p>
        <p>Deltatraveler. Really good fangame of Deltarune, what with it keeping the personality of the characters to canon.</p>
        <p>Gunpoint. Wow I use the word 'really' a lot. Anyways whenever I play a game with really good movement, it does things to my brain. I practice self control every second I am not defenestrating myself. You can jump out of windows in in this game BTW.</p>
        <p>Lisa the Timeless. really good lisa the painful fangame. idk why i like it so much more than the other fangames. maybe because it's more lighthearted? in any case play TImeless in Pointless.</p>
        <p>Lisa the Unbreakable. apparently this fangame used to suck eggs or something but then there was an update that made it coherent, and I played that version. sooo yea cool game theres actual combos, like one move leading into another.
        </p>
        <p>Modded Minecraft. i fucking love modded minecraft. notable mods include thaumcraft 4/6 and the wawa addons, chromaticraft the horrific sickly mod that makes you feel powerful while also hurting you, Hex Casting the spell mod that
         actually gave me a headache but then I watched one tutorial and then I got it instantly, betweenlands the really good swamp dimension mod that hurts you like your first night in minecraft.</p>
         <p>Outer Wilds. this is me running at you and grabbing you and throwing you full force into the sky while screaming PLay Outer Wilds! It's a fucking good game!! Try not to spoil yourself, and make sure to take breaks if you feel your brain start to slough off!!!</p>
         <p>Prequel Adventure: Making a Sad Cat Wait. I was there when the first purrgatory ended. One day, Katia will get off this rock.</p>
         <p>Rain World (Downpour). really good game. I think the trick into getting into Rain World is to just really get into being a wild sluggy. IDK.</p>
         <p>Shadows Over Loathing. Game good. Started to wear down after the fourth playthrough though (there was a vampire that was like "Is your name Mary?" and I wanted to see the dialogue for if the player name was set to Mary).</p>
         <p>Ultrakill. Cool game! Turns out you don't have to aim that much if you are also actively punching the enemies.</p>
         <p>World of IO (Pipe Dreamers, Curious Curios) really really good DnD show. PD is full of chaos/parenting/crime/crime/crime/oh my god so much crime/more parenting.</p>
         
    </div>   <div class="grub"><div class="gruel">Dormant Interests</div>
        <p>Modded Starbound. I don't know why I keep coming back to it.</p>
        <p>Cookie Run: Ovenbreak. stopped playing due to the content in the later yogurca updates. still! I'm glad I played it instead of the greedier gacha games. much harder for me to get hooked by the more horrendous gachas (seriously, 0.5% chance for a character!?)</p>
        <p>Butterscotch Shenanigans (Crashlands, Levelhead, Towelfight 2, etc.)</p>
