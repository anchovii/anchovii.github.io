        <p>The Outer Expanse is the region surrounding the walls of the city. Plantlife has flourished around the ruins that were abandoned outside.
            The region is plentiful with food, with berries and insects being found everywhere. Predators abound. however. with caramel-hued beasts being a common sight in these lands.
        </p>
        <div class="gruel">Metropolis<br><img src="image/RW_LC_region_art.png"></div><br>
        <p>A city placed on top of the Five Pebbles supercomputer. The Metropolis was constructed high above the clouds, in order to keep its citizens out of the rain. While the ancient civilization that initially constructed the place is now gone, it still contains plenty of life.
            Centipedes are a common sight, and can be seen skittering, and even flying through the air in search of food. Cyan-hued lizards leap from building to building, crossing the deadly gaps between them. If you look far enough into the horizon, you may be able to see other cities above the clouds.
        </p>
        <div class="gruel">Outskirts<br><img src="image/RW_SU_region_art.png"></div><br>
        <p>Placed just inside the walls of the city, the Outskirts is a relatively calm region. The predators that roam the area are less dangerous than others, and food is common. The region connects to many others, allowing you to move out of the city, further in, or even upwards to the Five Pebbles Supercomputer.</p>
        <div class="gruel">Shaded Citadel<br><img src="image/RW_SH_region_art.png"></div><br>
        A large cityscape, now in eternal darkness due to the Five Pebbles Supercomputer having been built directly above it. The Shaded Citadel previously held religious importance for some of the ancients, causing much commotion when construction of the supercomputer began.
        Nowadays, however, only creatures who can stand to live in the dark lurk here. Certain creatures have adapted to locate prey based on sound alone, while others are better at running away, and emitting light in order to see.
        <div class="gruel">Sky Islands<br><img src="image/RW_SI_region_art.png"></div><br>
        <p>Located near the clouds, the Sky Islands can be very dangerous for any creature that slips off the edge. Aerial creatures are commonplace here, with vultures roaming the skies in search of food.</p>
        <div class="gruel">Waterfront Facility<br><img src="image/RW_LM_region_art.png"></div><br>
        The location between the two supercomputers Five Pebbles and Looks to the Moon. Partially submerged in water, many aquatic creatures are located here. Salamanders and eels can be found in water and on land, and certain creatures mimic kelp, eating nearby unsuspecting creatures.
